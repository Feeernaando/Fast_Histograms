# General info
The following program is a code that allows a fast and reliable way to create histograms.

## The problem this code solves
Creating histograms generally is a task that involves sorting numbers and declaring the size of the bins. Such approach to creating an histogram requires lots of time to be executed properly. 
In order to arrange the values and create the bins to be filled it is necessary to load all the desired data to analyze, this can be a problem when working with hughe files.
Libraries like matplotlib ( hist function), NumPy( histogram function ) use the latter aproach and become useless if we need to analyze a file large enough to saturate our system RAM. And even with enough RAM the task may take hours.

Proprietary software as Igor and Origin are examples of software that may over come the issues with the publicly available options that I mentioned but a license is required. Acquiring such license is not always possible.

The code I (Fernando L.R.) propose takes advantage of the incredible performance of the FORTRAN language and provides a way to create an histogram in seconds with some minor trade backs which are the following:

* The maximum and minimum value of the bins have to be provided before analyzing the data. This may result in a first histogram that may not consider all the values in the data. This is barely an inconvenience as the codes generates the histograms way to fast. Its a matter of try and error to know that all the data in the file to analyze has been considered. At the end of the execution of the programme a report of how many datapoints were considered out of the total amount is given, you can use this as reference.

* The format of the histogram is not the usual bars. The size of the bin is declared at the beginning of the code and then the resulting graph is read as:
The bin is centered on the number of bin marked by the x value.
The bins have "no base" as its base is the corresponding x value that also marks the number of bin.

* The format in which the file of the histogram is saved is as

Bin number , frequency

The bin number is printed in the FORTRAN printing format F0.6 
which states that only 6 decimal numbers are to be printed. If the size of the bin is less than 0.000001 the format has to be adjusted too. If 8 digits are desired the format to use is F0.8 and has to be modified in the lines 120 and 127.

* At the time of uploading this these are all the details to be considered while using the code. If more arise when other are using it please contribute ;)

# Libraries used
The programme mostly uses built-in FORTRAN 90 functions. 

* IEEE_ARITHMETIC - This library is used in order to detect NaN and Infty values that may cause the programme to crash.

# Setup
To compile and execute the code the compiler gfortran is necessary. 

* In Linux (Ubunut) the code is compiled by typing in terminal

gfortran FastHistograms_6.f90 -o FastHistograms_6

* To execute it type in terminal

./FastHistograms_6

* To use the code create and specific folder. In such folder compile the code and save the files to be used to create the histogram.

# How to use it
In order to use the code the following variables need to be manually set by the user before compiling and executing the programme

!####
!Name of the file with the data that is to be sorted in a histogram.
CHARACTER(LEN=120) :: DATAFILE_OF_INTEREST = &
'Ex_Data_2.dat'

!Name of the file where the bins and height are stores, i.e. the histogram
CHARACTER(LEN=120) :: HISTOGRAM_FILE = &
'HISTOGRAM_Ex_Data_2.dat'

!Number of datapoints known in the file.
INTEGER(KIND = IDP), PARAMETER :: N = 10000

!Parameters to set the histograms characteristics 
REAL(KIND = DP), PARAMETER :: BIN_SIZE = 0.5 !With this variable you can set the size of the bins. !To be printed fully is necessary to configure the amount of characters to be printed at lines 113 and 120
REAL(KIND = DP), PARAMETER :: CENTRAL_VALUE = 0.0 !With this variable you set the central value of the histogram, by default it can be left set at 0.0.
REAL(KIND = DP), PARAMETER :: RIGHT_BOUND = 10 !With this variable you set the maximum value of the data to be considered while creating the histogram.
REAL(KIND = DP), PARAMETER :: LEFT_BOUND = -10 !With this variable you set the minimum value of the data to be considered while creating the histogram, if negative the minus has to be included in the stated value.

# Test datafile
In order for the user to give it a try along side this programme you can find two datasets named Ex_Data.dat and Ex_Data_2.dat each of those files contains 10,000 lines each containing a value. You can determine the statistics of such datasets by using the code. 

I also provide a short script for gnuplot in order to visualize the created histogram. The file is plot_histogram.plt

# Usage
I want to retain all the rights for the following code as my intention is for it to be used by anyone who needs a fast and reliable way to create histograms. If you want to contribute in a certain way I am open to discuss the terms of such contribution. Basically I just want this code to always be available to any student in need of creating an histogram
If you need to create histograms in a fast way, go on, this is intended for you ;)

# About
This piece of code was born during my thesis to obtain my degree as a physicist at the Faculty of Sciences at UNAM (in Mexico City). During my investigation I needed to analyze the statistics of Montecarlo simulations of 10^10 iterations with a resolution of 10 digits after the decimal point. Such conditions generate files of 60plus Gb. That no python library could handle, soâ€¦ I went back to my computational physics course In which my professor taught us that FORTRAN was the tool when high volumes of data are to be processed in a fast way. In the end FORTRAN was the answer. Indeed all the simulations of my thesis work were performed using FORTRAN and in the end I was able to develop all my investigation using only a pair of personal desktops around my house (Yep, COVID pandemic was in the way when I was developing my thesis)
